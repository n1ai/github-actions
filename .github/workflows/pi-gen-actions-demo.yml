          # custom stage directories are allowed here. Note that by default pi-gen exports
          # images in stage2 (lite), stage4 and stage5. You probably want to hook in custom
          # stages before one of the exported stages. Otherwise, the action will make sure
          # any custom stage will include an image export directive.
